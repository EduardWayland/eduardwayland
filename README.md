<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I am Eduard Wayland!</h1>
📝 I am a Full Stack Developer that loves everything about technology and never stops researching and learning. I dived in the development world with OOP languages *(Java, C#, C++)*, then expanded to Web oriented languages *(JS and most known frameworks)* and now I'm gaining experience with smart contracts development on Ethereum blockchain with Solidity.
